This directory holds all the code related to the Policy part of the ARI application.

When the system initializes:

1. A time collections file is read in
2. A user collection file is read in
3. A group collection file is read in
4. The policies are then read in

As and when the policies are read in, a List <Policy> is created.

Policy:
  PolicyCondition
  PolicyAction

These policies re created in the stack with no context. The context is supplied at runtime.

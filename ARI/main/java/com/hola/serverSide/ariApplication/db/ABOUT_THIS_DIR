This directory holds all the DB access related classes.

As of this writing, the following DBs are needed:

(a) A contacts DB, which is basically how Hola keeps the contact information
(b) A current call DB, which is where transient information regarding ongoing
    calls are kept.
(c) Billing and charging DB, which is where total minutes consumed etc. for
    each contact is kept.
(d) A call data record, which is where each contact's call duration, and other
    information (such as who the contact was talking to etc.) is kept.
